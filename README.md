42 school project about machine learning.
winequality-red.csv is dataset of wine with 11 attributes (acidity, Ph..) and quality score (0=bad, 10=excellent).
The objective is to determine quality of wine with attributes only.

We will create Perceptron and Adaline neural network from scratch.
I use python with panda, matplotlib, random and math. See Jupyter Notebook for results and explication.
