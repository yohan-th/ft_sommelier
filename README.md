# 42 school project about machine learning.
winequality-red.csv is a dataset of wine with 11 attributes (acidity, Ph..) and quality score (0=bad, 10=excellent).<br />
The objective is to determine the quality of wine with attributes only.<br />

I will create Perceptron and Adaline neural network from scratch. I used python with panda, matplotlib, and standard library.<br />
See Jupyter Notebook for results and explication or click <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yohan-th/ft_sommelier/blob/master/ft_sommelier.ipynb">here</a> and run it in Google collab.
